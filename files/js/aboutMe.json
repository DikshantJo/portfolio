        "description": "I am Dikshant Joshi.I am a Product Designer with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am working at finfocom which is a product based company based out of India. As a product designer, I would want to contribute to the complete project life cycle from the ideation phase to the implementation phase and also managing the same. Solving problems via digital products has been my passion over the past couple of years with penchant designing interfaces for new age devices like smartphones and wearables. I also have a strong notion that a good product is a concoction of good design, experience and technology.Apart from my work, when I am not behind my Desktop you can find me sitting in a cafe sipping a hot cup of cappuccino or in a restauranttrying out a new vegetarian dish or clicking photographs. I take occasional trips, at least once a year to detach myself from the daily routine and recharge myself.",
